        <h2>Work History</h2>

        <h3>Chavez Roofing & Construction: Business Development and Product Management	 </h3>
        <p>
          I met the owner of this company while working for AFI. Having seen what her honesty, quality of work, and ability to speak multiple languages did for our clients, I asked for a job. This role was business development, estimating, and managing projects. We were able to survive the economic issues that arose due to COVID by working  directly with the insurance carriers and avoiding  predatory behaviors  that have been far too common in the industry.
        </p>
        <h3>American Family Insurance</h3>
        <p>
          As a Property Field Adjuster, my role was to know the policy and maximize the coverage for the insured. Working from home, I would assess damages, write estimates, and issue checks to the client. This required knowledge of construction, engineering, and local code. I held this role for 4 years and am proud to have been one of their top performers. I was also involved at a corporate level helping to create and implement policies to imporve employee retention and productivity. Skills required to be a successful adjuster are being self motivated, problem solving, and people skills. 
        </p>
        <h3>Independant Catasptrophe Adjuster</h3>
        <p>
          As a catastrophe adjuster, working in tandum with the  National Flood Insurance Program, I would enter areas that were effected by flooding and document the damages to both residential  and  commercial properties. Theses reports would be used to  allocate federal revenue for under-insured  families, estimate payouts from insurance, and update the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
